            <p>
                We are a group of UC Berkeley School of Information students pursuing the Master's in Data Science and Information.
                This project was conducted during the summer session of 2024.
                Through our data visualization class, we learned about D3, Altair, and Tableau.
                Using our new acquired skills, we wanted to explore what impacts happiness and present our findings to a larger audience.

        <p>
            Our target users include a combination of individuals, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and general business decision-makers. 
            The information presented in our dashboard will be relevant for a diverse audience given the insights can be applied across many use cases. 
            For example, it may help non-profit organizations target funding to areas with a high potential impact on a nation’s happiness, or individuals evaluate an offer from their employer to relocate to another country.

        <h1 class="display-5">Summary</h1>
        <p>
            We have copied from our Final Project Exploratory Visualization and our Midterm Presentation, both of which we have previously submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The variables we chose, our charts and our analysis often copy or are adapted from the World Happiness Report.
            Our choice of chart types, our chart design choices and our construction of the charts, as well as our comments on them, usually draw from live sessions, async lectures, assignments and/or readings.
            Our work may also draw from examples provided of prior students’ final projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have utilized the Data Dictionary provided by the World Happiness Report in working on this project. This may not be shown in these specific dashboards/charts.
            In addition to the data provided on the World Happiness Report website, we also utilized an xls “Yearly trajectory by age group” provided upon e-mail request by the WHR Production Editor.

        <p>
            For the code, we referenced bootstrap's official template for Jumbotrons. We used the same dark mode navbar and CSS styles. Then, we incorporated our own project materials.
