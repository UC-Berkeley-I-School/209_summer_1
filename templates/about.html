    <p>
        We are a group of UC Berkeley School of Information students pursuing the Master's in Data Science and Information.
        We completed this project as part of our Data Visualization course during the summer session of 2024.
        Using what we learnt throughout the course we built this online tool to comprehensively visualize the World Happiness Report and wanted to present our findings to a larger audience.

        The variables we chose, our charts, dashboards, design, content and our analysis often copy or are adapted from the World Happiness Report website, report(s) and dashboard. 
        In addition to the data provided on the World Happiness Report website, we also utilized an xls “Yearly trajectory by age group” provided upon e-mail request by the WHR Production Editor.
        We have utilized the Data Dictionary provided by the World Happiness Report in working on this project.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to data from the World Happiness Report we have also included data on continents from the World Population Review and data on population from the World Bank.
        We have also used chart designs from Our World in Data visualizations that also utilize the World Happiness Report dataset.

        Our final project presented here utilizes content from our Midterm Presentation, Usability Study, Final Project Exploratory Visualization, and our Proposal, all of which we submitted previously as part of this project.
        Our final project presented here incorporates a number of changes/ideas from our Usability Study, including some directly suggested by our study participants.
        We thank them for their time, support and insights.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dashboard tasks, data and example use cases copy from our project’s midterm presentation, Munzner, T. (2014), World Happiness Report website and data, our project's Usability Study, our project's Exploratory Analysis, and course asynchronous modules.
        Our choice of chart types, our chart design choices and our construction of the charts, are usually taken from live sessions, asynchronous modules, and/or assignments completed as part of our Data Visualization course.
        Our work may also draw from examples provided of prior students’ final projects, as well as other student's work we have seen throughout the course.

    <p>
        For the code, we referenced bootstrap's official template for Jumbotrons. We used the same dark mode navbar and CSS styles. Then, we incorporated our own project materials.
