            We will give users easy access to information on global happiness through an interactive, web-hosted visualization tool that utilizes data from the World Happiness Report (WHR). 
            Our project will create a dashboard that enables users to freely toggle between and compare various happiness metrics in any way they see fit, whether that be looking at a specific contributor to happiness across the world or a time series analysis of the rate of change in a countryâ€™s happiness score over time.</p>

        <p>
            The primary task for our visualization tool is to answer key questions on happiness based on a range of topics and compare these rankings relative to countries. 
            Another task is to learn about these trends over time and enable the user to leave our tool with conclusions or with more follow-up questions for the user to return to the site in search of more answers. 
            Ultimately, our end goal is to be a trusted analytical tool for all users when thinking about global and national happiness.
